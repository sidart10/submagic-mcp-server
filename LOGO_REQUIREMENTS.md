## Design Guidelines

### ✅ DO

- **Use high contrast colors** - Ensures visibility on light and dark backgrounds
- **Keep it simple** - Bold, recognizable designs work best
- **Test at small sizes** - Logo will be displayed at 64×64 and smaller
- **Use vector graphics when possible** - For clean, sharp edges
- **Consider the context** - Think "video editing" theme
- **Brand consistency** - Use colors that represent Submagic or video content

### ❌ DON'T

- **Avoid small text** - Won't be readable when scaled down
- **Avoid complex details** - Gets lost at thumbnail sizes
- **Avoid low contrast** - Makes logo hard to see
- **Avoid copyrighted images** - Unless you have permission
- **Avoid offensive content** - Keep it professional
